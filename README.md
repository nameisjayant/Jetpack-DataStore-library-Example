# Jetpack-DataStore-library-Example

What is DataStore 🤷‍♀️?
Jetpack DataStore is a data storage solution.
It allows us to store key-value pairs (like SharedPreferences) or typed objects with protocol buffers
DataStore uses Kotlin, Coroutines and Flow to store data asynchronously with consistency and transaction support 😍.
In short, it’s the new data storage solution which is the replacement of SharedPreferences.


Why DataStore 🤷‍♂️
First and my favourite reason 😃 — Built with❤️ Kotlin, Coroutines and Flow.
If you have used SharedPreferences you might abuse or blamed it for something 😆 then DataStore is here to rescue!
SharedPreference has some drawbacks like it provided synchronous APIs -but it’s not MAIN-thread-safe! whereas DataStore is safe to use in UI thread because it uses Dispatchers.IO under the hood👀.
It’s safe from runtime exceptions!❌⚠️. What would be more satisfying that? 😅
It also provides a way to migrate from SharedPreferences 😍.
It provides Type safety! (Using Protocol buffers).
These are some reasons which encourage us to use DataStore and finally say goodbye to beloved SharedPreferences 👋.

Let’s begin code 👨‍💻

We’ll develop a sample Android application which stores a UI mode preference from user i.e. 🌞 Light Mode or 🌑 Dark Mode.
